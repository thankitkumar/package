## Core Features:

- Core Components: Component Library: Collection of reusable, unstyled UI components such as buttons, inputs, modals, and dropdowns that are accessible and composable.
- Framework Adapters: Framework Wrappers: Provide wrappers or adapters for React, Vue, Angular, and Next.js to ensure compatibility and ease of integration.
- Theming: Theme System: Implement a flexible theming system to allow developers to customize the appearance of the components with CSS variables and custom themes.
- Accessibility Support: Accessibility: Ensure all components meet accessibility standards (WCAG) by providing appropriate ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support.
- Platform Agnostic: Cross-Platform: Make compatible the generated code to work with Web, Mobile, and Desktop environments. 
- AI-powered Component Generator: Component Variants Generator: Use a generative AI tool to suggest component variants based on design requirements, improving developer's workflow. The tool suggests modifications for parameters such as: color, dimension, position, etc.

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#329DFF) for a modern and versatile look.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
